<h2 id="dissolution">Dissolution</h2>

<p>Dissolution is a first person shooter video game where all of your items are represented by crypto-currency tokens. For this project I designed both the database to manage users and their items as well as a server solution, using AWS lambda functions, to connect the game to the Etheruem network.</p>

<p>Xenum.io was a market place for crypto-currency collectibles. It offered a set of APIs for game developers to easily integrate items into their games, as well as a set of smart contracts that allowed users to create their very own collectible trading platform and to make and sell their own custom items, all with no Ethereum network fees to the creator.</p>
